# Assignment on Securing Accounts for CS50 Cybersecurity

✅ - Correct Answer

❌ - Wrong Answer

## Question 1 ✅

Characterize the difference between a database hack and a database leak.

## Question 2 ✅

In what sense might files not actually be deleted even if you empty the recycle bin on Windows or empty the trash on macOS?

## Question 3 ❌

How do quantum computers differ from traditional (non-quantum) computers?

## Question 4 ❌

What is the term for the prevailing method via which public-key (i.e., asymmetric) cryptography enables two parties to establish a shared secret, even over an insecure (i.e., unencrypted) channel?

## Question 5 ✅

What is a salt, in the context of this lecture?

## Question 6 ✅

Suppose that Alice and Bob need to coordinate a meeting, as by exchanging emails using Microsoft Outlook, a popular client for email.

If their emails are encrypted in-transit, who (besides Alice and Bob) might nonetheless be able to read the emails if anyone, and why?

## Question 7 ✅

Suppose that you have been hired to perform some work for Charlie. After agreeing to terms, you send the contract to Charlie via email, and, later that day, you receive a digitally signed copy from an email address that appears to belong to Charlie but isn't the one to which you sent the contract originally.

How can you be as certain as possible, **technologically** (that is, without consulting Charlie) that Charlie was the one who digitally signed the contract?

## Question 8 ✅

MD5 is an example of a still popular hashing algorithm that has been in use since the early 1990s. [Read this article](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/md5/) about MD5 before continuing on.

Note that MD5 is a 128-bit algorithm, meaning its digests (i.e. hash values) are always 128 bits in length, and therefore there are 2^128 unique digests available. Thus, understand that the article's critique that there is a "high potential for collisions," while not invalid or indeed even incorrect, is perhaps something that should be understood with a bit of context.

Suppose that a company has made a large file available for download via its website. Why might they also make available the MD5 hash of that file (as is indeed a common practice)?

## Question 9 ✅

Identify one or more significant differences between a cipher and a hash.

## Question 10 ✅

No, the above isn't random typing! :)
