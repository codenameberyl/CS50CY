## Question 6 ✅

Pragmatically, the above comic may be correct as it pertains to the behavior of most users towards open-source software. Even if that is your attitude towards it, why might it still be a good thing to consider using more open-source software (or, developing it), from a security-minded perspective?

## Question 7 ✅

In lecture, we discussed the notion of using app stores (such as Apple's App Store, Google Play Store, Microsoft Store, etc.) as a means of helping us to police our own security by relying on these "big players" to do some vetting.

What is a downside to only downloading software from app stores such as these?

## Question 8 ✅

What threat does use of Content-Security-Policy fields in our source code help to defend against?

## Question 9 ✅

Provide a specific example of a situation when you might want to use the HTTP POST method instead of the HTTP GET method.

## Question 10 ✅

More precisely known as [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-0160) but better known as [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed), the discovery of this exploit caused quite an internet panic in 2014, resulting in one of the first times a bug was actively publicized in mass media outlets, as cybersecurity researchers scrambled to make the public aware of the bug and to encourage rapid download of the fix.

Read up on Heartbleed either via the Wikipedia article linked in the previous paragraph, or via any other research you like (such as this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCGKf1XD-ME)).

Why was Heartbleed such a threat to a user's security?
